# STRUCTLISH
A slightly modified version of Structured English meant for educational use.

## What Is STRUCTLISH?
STRUCTLISH is a simple esoteric programming language designed to be easy to read and understand.
It follows many of the rules of Structured English, and is inspired by it.
### Inspirations:
Structured English, BASIC, COBOL, Python, Ruby.

## Using STRUCTLISH:
It can't be used yet.

## Basic Rules of STRUCTLISH:
- A name must be provided at the top of the script.
- All keywords must be capitalised.
- All statements must have an end of statement below them.
- A data type must be declared before the data.
- An `EXIT` must be provided at the end of the script.

## Style Guide:
- Indent content of statements by one level.
- Use only lowercase for variables.
- Separate words in variables with underscores (`my_variable`).
